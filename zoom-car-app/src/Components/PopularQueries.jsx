          We understand that driving can get tiring on a long drive and you want
          to share driving responsibilities with a friend. Simply add co-drivers
          through the Co-Drivers page in your account. This will ensure that in
          case of any damage while your friend is driving, liability is limited
          to the security deposit (under our usual conditions). If your friend
          is not a Zoomcar user already, we will ask them to upload their DL and
          then review it. If your friend is already a Zoomcar user then their DL
          has most likely already been approved. Please do remember, you are
          still responsible for the vehicle during your reservation.
          Additionally if a non-Zoomcar verified person drives the vehicle,
          Zoomcar's insurance coverage would be invalidated and you will face
          unlimited liability.
