          The member will be liable for 100% of the entire vehicle damage bill
          in the event that the vehicle workshop and/or insurance company deem
          the damage to be consequential in nature (this will be clearly stated
          in the accident report). Consequential damage occurs when the member
          continues driving even after an external vehicle impact, thereby
          severely undermining the condition of the vehicle.
